# Rust Enum Question 2

## Question 2

Create a Rust enum called `Sport` that has the following variants:

- Basketball
- Volleyball
- Football
- Cricket

Make a state machine to change the state of the enum from one variant to another.

__Use BOTH Mehtod, and associated function.__

The state machine should be able to change the state of the enum from one variant to another.
And it should have a method defined to do so as well as an associated function to do so.
